## Conclusion 🎓

This analysis provides valuable insights into the economies of different countries and the relationships between various economic indicators. However, it is just a starting point, and there are many other ways to analyze and visualize the data. For example, one could create scatter plots to visualize the relationships between different indicators, or use clustering algorithms to group countries with similar economic characteristics. Additionally, one could also investigate the impact of other factors, such as political stability or natural resources, on the economy.

## Note 📝

It's important to remember that correlation does not imply causation, and these relationships should be investigated further before drawing any conclusions.
